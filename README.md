Welcome to the Kaya AI's Mnemonic Phrase to Hexadecimal Entropy Converter! This software allows you to convert a Mnemonic phrase into an entropy and outputs this entropy in hexadecimal format. The main language used in this tool is C# with the help of NBitcoin library.

## Usage
You can use this software in two different ways:

Mnemonic Phrase: Enter a mnemonic phrase directly to the console when prompted.<br>
TXT File: Provide the path to a TXT file containing one mnemonic phrase per line.<br>

## Step by Step Guide
Start the program. The program will present two options: "1. Mnemonic Phrase" and "2. TXT File".

If you choose "1. Mnemonic Phrase", you will be asked to directly enter the mnemonic phrase into the console.

If you choose "2. TXT File", you will be asked to provide the path to the TXT file. Each line of the TXT file should contain a single mnemonic phrase.

After entering the mnemonic phrase or the path to the TXT file, the program will convert each mnemonic phrase to its entropy in hexadecimal form and output the results.

If an error occurs during the conversion process, the program will display an error message.

Press enter to exit the program.
